Daylight Saving Time is still stupid.

What should I do with all my old blog posts? Part of me wants to delete them,
part of me wants to preface them with an "I was young and stupid" disclaimer.

omg this document is now `text/markdown` for no sensible reason. I [hacked
on][1] [borismus/markdown-preview][2] specifically so it would convert his
page:

* Primarily cares about Content-Type header (this page doesn't have `.md` in
  the URL)
* Converts `text/markdown` documents
* Will also convert `text/plain` documents if the path ends in `.md`

I'm putting on a benefit dance for Introverts with Anxiety Disorder. It's
called The Stress Ball. Everyone will RSVP "yes" and nobody will show up.
