Daylight Saving Time is still stupid. What should I do with all my old blog
posts? Part of me wants to delete them, part of me wants to add an "I was
young and stupid" disclaimer to most (all?) of them.

omg this document is now `text/markdown` for no sensible reason. I [hacked
on](https://github.com/abackstrom/markdown-preview)
[borismus/markdown-preview](https://github.com/borismus/markdown-preview) so
it would convert this Markdown document to HTML on page load. Why.

Extension changes:

* Primarily cares about Content-Type header
* Converts `text/markdown` documents
* Will also convert `text/plain` documents if the path ends in `.md`

I'm putting on a benefit dance for Introverts with Anxiety Disorder. It's
called The Stress Ball. Everyone will RSVP "yes" and nobody will show up.
